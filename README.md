02.GIT.Local 
My first experience using the GIT version control system.
I use a virtual machine deployed in the Proxmox hypervisor on a production server.
I use Linux Debian version 11.7 as the operating system.
At the moment I installed git, installed zhsk instead of bash (But I have not yet figured out how it
works and how to configure it :)). I created a new directory in which I initialized the GIT repository.
I signed whose GIT it is, but not yet globally. I created a new file (Iâ€™m writing in it now), in which
I wrote the first line. Staged and committed this file. I created a new thread and am writing this text.
